This project is just a project I used to learn more about Keystonejs, Nextjs and Apollo.

# Basics
I started from the "KeystoneJS Todo List Template" but extended that to include a Password Auth Strategy.  I also messed around with Nextjs private routes.

# Styling
I used Reactstrap throughout the app as I didn't really want to think about styling. Reactstrap seemed to work ok and makes the code a little cleaner and easier to understand.
